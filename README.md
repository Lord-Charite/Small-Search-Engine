Overview

This C program provides functionality to read data from a file, delete records, and perform lookups or updates on the information stored in the file. The program uses a simple file format where each record represents information about an entity (e.g., a person) and consists of fields separated by a delimiter.

Features

- Read File: The program can read data from the file and display it on the console.
- Delete Record: You can delete a record from the file based on a specified key (e.g., name).
- Lookup/Update Record: The program allows you to search for a record by a key (e.g., name) and either display the information or update it with new data.
